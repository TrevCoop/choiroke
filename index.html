<h1>Choiroke</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Singing together is fun and good for you! Singing in front of other people can be scary, especially if we have perfectionist tendencies. Let's try to ignore that and just focus on the fun parts!</p>
<p class="paragraph">Choiroke is a short, sober, afternoon singalong where we all get a chance to learn the songs in advance. Each song will have a leader, but everyone is encouraged to participate, whether that's through singing (harmonies encouraged), dancing, clapping, or using an instrument. The leader can sing the song well, but that's definitely not required. This is a supportive atmosphere where we focus more on participation than performance.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p class="paragraph">If you would like to lead on songs, <a href="mailto:sing@choiroke.ca" >send us</a> both the karaoke YouTube link, and a link to the original song. We'll pick a set and arrange them into a playlist that's one hour long. Then we publish the song list so we have a chance to listen to the songs in advance. Show up to the event, and when your song(s) come up, get up and lead us in singing!</p>
<h2>Date and time</h2>
<p class="paragraph">We'll meet about every two months on a Sunday afternoon, generally from 2:30 PM - 3:30 PM.
Singing starts at 2:30 sharp, so aim to get there by 2:15. We'll have half an hour to clean up and wind down.</p>
